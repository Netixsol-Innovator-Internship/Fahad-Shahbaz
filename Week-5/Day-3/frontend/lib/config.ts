// Central frontend runtime config
// Replace the URL below with your Railway app URL when deployed, e.g.
// export const BACKEND_URL = 'https://your-backend.up.railway.app';
// For quick deploys to Railway set this to the Railway URL directly.
// Example: 'https://my-backend.up.railway.app'
export const BACKEND_URL = "https://your-backend.up.railway.app";
